- [x] **Add balance directives** - Fetch and include balance directives from PocketSmith ✅ COMPLETED

#### 🔧 Quality Gates to Implement
- [x] **Add mypy to uv dependencies** - Start requiring mypy checks before local commits, and add it to the GitHub PR check workflow. Add it to the README. Start with `--strict`, and add `--ignore-missing-imports` if necessary. Fix any type errors ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add pre-commit to uv dependencies** - Add current checks to pre-commit: mypy, pytest, bean-check, ruff ✅ COMPLETED



### ✅ Phase 6: Advanced File Management & Archive Features (PENDING)

#### 📁 Multi-File Beancount Structure
- [ ] **Implement hierarchical file organization** - Create top-level beancount file with account declarations, category declarations, and includes
- [ ] **Monthly transaction files** - Organize transactions into one file per month (YYYY-MM.beancount)
- [ ] **Yearly folder structure** - Place monthly files in calendar year folders (e.g., 2024/2024-01.beancount)
- [ ] **Update file writer** - Modify BeancountFileWriter to support multi-file output structure
- [ ] **Add include statements** - Generate proper include directives in top-level file

#### 🔢 Data Type Improvements  
- [ ] **Convert IDs to decimal numbers** - Change transaction and account IDs from strings to decimal numbers in beancount output
- [ ] **Update metadata handling** - Ensure all ID fields use decimal representation consistently
- [ ] **Validate decimal conversion** - Add error handling for invalid ID formats

#### 💰 Enhanced Account Declarations
- [ ] **Use starting balance data** - Look for starting_balance and starting_balance_date in transaction account objects
- [ ] **Account declaration dates** - Use starting_balance_date as the account declaration date when available
- [ ] **Starting balance directives** - Include starting balance declarations in top-level beancount file
- [ ] **Handle missing balance data** - Graceful fallback when starting balance information is not available

#### 📝 Transaction Changelog
- [ ] **Implement compact changelog** - Create changelog file recording transaction operations
- [ ] **Single-line format** - Use compact format instead of JSON for space efficiency
- [ ] **AEST timestamps** - Include millisecond-resolution timestamps in Australian Eastern Standard Time
- [ ] **Operation tracking** - Record create, modify, delete operations for transactions
- [ ] **Field-level changes** - For modifications, specify which field changed with old and new values
- [ ] **Example format** - `Aug 7 06:47:42.774 MODIFY 856546480 tags: [] -> #restaurants`

#### 🕒 Transaction Metadata Enhancements
- [ ] **Last modified datetime** - Add metadata field using updated_at from transaction object
- [ ] **AEST timezone handling** - Convert timestamps to Australian Eastern Standard Time
- [ ] **Datetime format handling** - Try datetime.datetime first, fallback to string if needed
- [ ] **Closing balance metadata** - Add closing_balance field as decimal number for future balance assertions

#### 🔄 Incremental Archive Updates
- [ ] **Archive-based updates** - Replace full file rewrites with incremental updates to existing archive
- [ ] **Transaction creation** - Handle new transactions from upstream service
- [ ] **Transaction updates** - Detect and update modified transactions from upstream
- [ ] **Metadata synchronization** - Ensure last modified datetime is updated for changed transactions
- [ ] **Conflict resolution** - Handle cases where local and upstream data differ
