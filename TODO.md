### ✅ Test Statistics (ACHIEVED)
- **Total Tests**: 482 tests (increased from ~200)
- **New Test Files**: 16 comprehensive test files
- **Property-Based Tests**: Hypothesis integration across all modules
- **Test Categories**: Unit tests, integration tests, property-based tests, error handling tests
- **Coverage Focus**: All major modules (beancount, changelog, compare, pocketsmith, resolve)

### ⚠️ Current Test Status (NEEDS ATTENTION)
- **Working Tests**: 343 passed, 1 skipped
- **Failing Tests**: 136 failed, 2 errors
- **Coverage**: 43% overall (measured on working modules only)
- **Target**: 90% coverage goal

### 🐛 Issues to Address (PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Fix test failures in beancount module** - Align test expectations with actual function implementations (19 failures)
- [ ] **Fix test failures in pocketsmith module** - API client and rate limiter tests need implementation alignment (6 failures) 
- [ ] **Fix test failures in resolve module** - Strategy implementation differences (17 failures)
- [ ] **Fix test failures in changelog module** - Printer and formatting test issues (2 errors)
- [ ] **Update import paths** - Some modules may have different structure than expected
- [ ] **Verify function signatures** - Ensure test calls match actual function signatures

### 🚀 Next Steps to 90% Coverage (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] **Fix failing unit tests** - Correct test expectations to match actual implementations
- [ ] **Add missing function coverage** - Cover remaining uncovered lines in existing modules
- [ ] **Enhance property-based testing** - Expand hypothesis coverage for edge cases
- [ ] **Integration test improvements** - End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Memory usage and large dataset handling
